1.Create folder 'Test' in your home directory
    mkdir Test 
    cd Test
2.Create below files
- employeelist   
   cat >employeelist
 - skillset
    cat >skillset
3.Create folder Test2 in home directory
    mkdir Test2
- create symbolink and hard link for skillset file 
    ln -s skillset slink_employeelist
    ln -s skillset hlink_employeelist
- delete skillset file and check if hardlink and symbolic link file exists
    rm skillset,cat slink-employeelist
     [no such file or directory]
    rm skillset, cat hlink_employeelist
    [it shows the same list in skillset]
- explain the difference b/n symbolic and hard links
    In slink  we delete the original file then it doesnot exists in linked file but in hlink it exists in linkedfile ans also inode number is same for originalfile and linkedfile
4.Provide read and write permission to 'user2' group 
    chmod 773 filename or chmod g+rw filename 
-test if user2 group users can access the file
    ls -l filename
5.Revoke write permission from user2 group and test the access again
   chmod g-w filename
   ls -l filename
6. Grant write permission for others and test it 
   chmod o+w filename
   ls -l filename
7.Revoke write permission for others and test again
   chmod o-w filename
   ls -l filename
8.Change the group of employeelist file to 'user3'
   chgrp user2 employeelist
9.Change ownership of the file to user5 and test
   chown user2 employeelist
10.check how many employees are there  (hint: use wc command)
   employeelist | wc -l
